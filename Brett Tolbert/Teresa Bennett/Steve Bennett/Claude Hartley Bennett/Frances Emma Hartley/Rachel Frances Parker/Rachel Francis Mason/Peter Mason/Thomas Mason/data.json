    "bio": "<p>Parents: Records identify his father as John Mason (born approx. 1700) and his mother as Dorothy Sanders. Some sources also suggest a lineage back to Roger Mason Sr. and Mary \"Molly\" Andrews, though the Hanover County origins are more frequently cited in this family branch.</p><p>Family tradition often links this Mason branch to the prominent George Mason family of Virginia (the author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights), suggesting Thomas may have been a distant cousin. However, researchers typically distinguish this specific \"Roanoke River\" Mason line as a separate, though likely related, colonial branch.</p><p>His son, Peter Mason, was born in this same region of North Carolina in 1761 before the family eventually migrated further south to Georgia and Alabama.</p>"
